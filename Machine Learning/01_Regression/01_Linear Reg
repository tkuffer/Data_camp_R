###Linear Regression


##The task is to predict the rate of female unemployment from the observed rate of male unemployment. The outcome is female_unemployment, and the input is male_unemployment.

# unemployment is loaded in the workspace
summary(unemployment)

# Define a formula to express female_unemployment as a function of male_unemployment
fmla <- female_unemployment~male_unemployment

# Print it
fmla

# Use the formula to fit a model: unemployment_model
unemployment_model <- lm(fmla, data=unemployment)

# Print it
unemployment_model

# Call summary() on unemployment_model to get more details
summary(unemployment_model)

# Call glance() on unemployment_model to see the details in a tidier form
glance(unemployment_model)

# Call wrapFTest() on unemployment_model to see the most relevant details
wrapFTest(unemployment_model)

##use  unemployment model to make predictions from the unemployment data, and compare predicted female unemployment rates to the actual observed female unemployment rates on the training data, unemployment. You will also use your model to predict on the new data in newrates, which consists of only one observation, where male unemployment is 5%.

# unemployment is in your workspace
summary(unemployment)

# newrates is in your workspace
newrates

# Predict female unemployment in the unemployment data set
unemployment$prediction <-  predict(unemployment_model)

# load the ggplot2 package
library(ggplot2)

# Make a plot to compare predictions to actual (prediction on x axis). 
ggplot(unemployment, aes(x = prediction, y = female_unemployment)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(color = "blue")

# Predict female unemployment rate when male unemployment is 5%
pred <- predict(unemployment_model, newdata = newrates)
# Print it
pred


### Multivariate linear Regression

# bloodpressure is in the workspace
summary(bloodpressure)

# Create the formula and print it
fmla <- blood_pressure~age+weight
fmla

# Fit the model: bloodpressure_model
bloodpressure_model <- lm(fmla,data=bloodpressure)

# Print bloodpressure_model and call summary() 
bloodpressure_model
summary(bloodpressure_model)

##make predictions using the blood pressure model bloodpressure_model 

# bloodpressure is in your workspace
summary(bloodpressure)

# bloodpressure_model is in your workspace
bloodpressure_model

# predict blood pressure using bloodpressure_model :prediction
bloodpressure$prediction <- predict(bloodpressure_model)

# plot the results
ggplot(bloodpressure, aes(x = prediction, y = blood_pressure))+ 
    geom_point() +
    geom_abline(color = "blue")
