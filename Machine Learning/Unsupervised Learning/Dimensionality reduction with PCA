####create a PCA model of the data, then to inspect the resulting model using the summary() function.

# Perform scaled PCA: pr.out
pr.out <- prcomp(pokemon, scale = TRUE)

# Inspect model output
summary(pr.out)

###prepare data from the pr.out model you created at the beginning of the chapter for use in a scree plot. Preparing the data for plotting is required because there is not a built-in function in R to create this type of plot.

# Variability of each principal component: pr.var
pr.var <- pr.out$sdev^2

# Variance explained by each principal component: pve
pve <- pr.var / sum(pr.var)
pve

###create a scree plot showing the proportion of variance explained by each principal component, as well as the cumulative proportion of variance explained.
# Plot variance explained for each principal component
plot(pve, xlab = "Principal Component",
     ylab = "Proportion of Variance Explained",
     ylim = c(0, 1), type = "b")

# Plot cumulative proportion of variance explained
plot(cumsum(pve), xlab = "Principal Component",
     ylab = "Cumulative Proportion of Variance Explained",
     ylim = c(0, 1), type = "b")
     
# Mean of each variable
colMeans(pokemon)

# Standard deviation of each variable
apply(pokemon, 2, sd)

# PCA model with scaling: pr.with.scaling
pr.with.scaling <- prcomp(pokemon,scale=TRUE)
# PCA model without scaling: pr.without.scaling
pr.without.scaling <- prcomp(pokemon)
# Create biplots of both for comparison
biplot(pr.with.scaling)
biplot(pr.without.scaling)

##The new Total column contains much more variation, on average, than the other four columns, so it has a disproportionate effect on the PCA model when scaling is not performed. After scaling the data, there's a much more even distribution of the loading vectors.
